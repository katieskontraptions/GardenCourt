            This is a spectacular wildlife setting. You can view a variety of geese, 
            ducks, cranes, and white pelicans. Clear Lake is the largest natural lake in 
            California. Its green hue originates from all the algae that grows in the 
            lake. This area is a fisherman's delight, voted one of the best bass fishing 
            spots in the world.  You will find great fishing for bass, catfish, and blue 
            gill right off the private piers. Large bass and catfish are commonly caught 
            off the pier during peak fishing season (March-July).  This contemporary style 
            home is ready to serve you and your family with the comfort and convenience of 
            your home.
