        This is a spectacular wildlife setting. You can view a variety of geese, 
        ducks, cranes, and white pelicans. Clear Lake is the largest natural lake in 
        California. Its green hue originates from all the algae that grows in the 
        lake. This area is a fisherman's delight, voted one of the best bass fishing 
        spots in the world.  You will find great fishing for bass, catfish, and blue 
        gill right off the private piers. Large bass and catfish are commonly caught 
        off the pier during peak fishing season (March-July).  This contemporary style 
        home is ready to serve you and your family with the comfort and convenience of 
        your home.
